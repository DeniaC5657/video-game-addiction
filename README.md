# Video Game Addiction

For my project, I am addressing the problem of why video game controllers are so uncomfortable. I’m noticing that many controllers are uncomfortable in a person's hand, so I decided to create a controller that is comfortable in the hand. Not too heavy, rough, and easy on the eye. This blog will walk through my process of creating this innovation.

In the long run, the information about the video game addiction and the cause and effect of addictions. Can show the real truth and the life of someone who’s facing addictions. Plus showing the help and side effects of addictions.

Addiction could affect a person's mental and physical health but most important to try and understand that if you’re addicted to anything such as drugs, alcohol and even to your smartphone. Do try to have control or contact someone who can help you. Also it's okay that you’re addicted to anything but do get help, no matter what state of the addiction you always have control and help. 

This view of addiction in the technology world could be as strong than any other drug, as we know, technology is everywhere. Literally. But we need to have control, we can’t let technology fully take over us, we need our time to breath peacefully without worrying about our smartphones. These graphics of the newest technology could make us the most easily addicted to these devices. It is small, compact, good graphic, and easy to search the web.

# Technology VS Addiction

As for other addictions, it is crucial not only to recognize the amount of time spent on gaming but also the role it serves the user while contemplating the likelihood of a video game addiction. Video game play can not be dangerous or imply an addiction, as one in a number in leisure behaviors. On the other side, because playing game becomes addictive, it takes over as the key way the individual copes with life, as a consequence of which certain essential aspects of existence are ignored or disturbed.
