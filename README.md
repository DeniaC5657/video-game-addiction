# Video Game Addiction

For my project, I am addressing the problem of why video game controllers are so uncomfortable. I’m noticing that many controllers are uncomfortable in a person's hand, so I decided to create a controller that is comfortable in the hand. Not too heavy, rough, and easy on the eye. This blog will walk through my process of creating this innovation.

In the long run, the information about the video game addiction and the cause and effect of addictions. Can show the real truth and the life of someone who’s facing addictions. Plus showing the help and side effects of addictions.

Addiction could affect a person's mental and physical health but most important to try and understand that if you’re addicted to anything such as drugs, alcohol and even to your smartphone. Do try to have control or contact someone who can help you. Also it's okay that you’re addicted to anything but do get help, no matter what state of the addiction you always have control and help. 

This view of addiction in the technology world could be as strong than any other drug, as we know, technology is everywhere. Literally. But we need to have control, we can’t let technology fully take over us, we need our time to breath peacefully without worrying about our smartphones. These graphics of the newest technology could make us the most easily addicted to these devices. It is small, compact, good graphic, and easy to search the web.

# Knowledge of the Video Game Addiction 

This project is to make gamers feel more knowledgeable about their gaming time, making sure they have control over the controller. I’m pleased with my progress so far, as my code can automatically create a “simulating” based on common video game addicted gamers effects. Using code in A-Frame and learning the sizes and positions of the 3D shapes, base on this learning, I was able to create my best starter model, using basic 3D shapes to form a full model picture of ‘Video Game Addictions’
